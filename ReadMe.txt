Everything you need to create a mod is located in Mods/.
Mods/ModData is a complete template mod using current WARNO data, it may be updated by steam. /!\ Do not work in ModData/ you will not have clean data for other mods otherwise.
To create a new mod, run CreateNewMod.bat with a name for your mod. It will create a new directory for your mod. Ex:

C:\...\WARNO\Mods> CreateNewMod.bat MyAwesomeMod

Once you've got your own directory you can :
- modify your data
- generate your mod by launching GenerateMod.bat
- activate it in-game within the ModCenter menu
- upload it to the Steam Workshop by launching UploadMod.bat
- update your mod to work with a new version of the game by running UpdateMod.bat

If you get into trouble during your mod creation you can get support at the Eugen Systems Forum (http://forums.eugensystems.com/).
